<h2>WEB</h2>
  <P>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web,
     is the world's dominant software platform.
     It was originally a hypertext document management system accessed
     over the Internet.
     The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext
     Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software
     application called a web browser, and are published by a software
     application called a web server.

<h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <P>JavaScript is a high-level programming language that follows
     the ECMAScript standard. It was originally designed as a scripting
     language for websites but became widely adopted as
     a general-purpose programming language, and is currently
     the most popular programming language in use.
    JavaScript is usually found running in a web browser as interactive
    or automated content, ranging from popup messages and live clocks
     to large web applications. JavaScript is also commonly used in
     server-side programming through platforms like Node.js,or "embedded"
     in non-JavaScript applications where the base programming
      language lacks the high-level functionality that JavaScript
     offers.
